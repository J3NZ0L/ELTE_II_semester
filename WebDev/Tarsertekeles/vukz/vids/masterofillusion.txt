[Verse 1]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the greatest of them all?
I'm the master of illusion
Welcome to my mad delusion
I'm the one who makes the rules
For the heroes and the fools
I can tear down angels from the sky
And make Mona Lisa cry

[Pre-Chorus]
You can hear the weeping violins
Long before the bitter end begins
You can see the strings and puppeteer
Before the dusk will make them disappear

[Chorus]
The game is over
No morе rounds to play, it's time to pay
Who's got the joker?
Thе game is over
Who's got the joker
To kill the lies and make your heart recall
There's no other sky to fall

[Verse 2]
The dominoes of greed
Are falling for your endless needs
You're the master of illusion
Lost in your sad delusion
Every time you roll the dice
We're the ones who pay the price
While the oceans boil for your games
You just feed the flames

[Pre-Chorus]
You can hear the weeping violins
Long before the bitter end begins
You can see the strings and puppeteer
Before the dusk will make them disappear

[Chorus]
The game is over
No more rounds to play, it's time to pay
Who's got the joker?
The game is over
Who's got the joker
To kill the lies and make your heart recall
There's no other sky to fall

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And you will ask:
"Which one am I?
Am I dead or still alive?"
Reflections of the real fade
The stranger in the mirror remains
Can you hear the weeping violins
And cut the strings before the end begins?
[Chorus]
The game is over
No more rounds to play, it's time to pay
Who's got the joker?
The game is over
Who's got the joker?
We are the ones; we hold the cards
There's no other sky to fall
