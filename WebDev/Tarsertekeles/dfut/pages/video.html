0:02 stuff okay everything is available<br>
0:04 basically for free you can learn<br>
0:06 anything you want for free it is not a<br>
0:09 question of learning there there is a<br>
0:13 value that colleges have which is like<br>

The value of college<br>
0:20 can't somebody work hard at something<br>
0:21 including a bunch of sort of annoying<br>
