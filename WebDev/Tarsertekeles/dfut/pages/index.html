      <h1>Why you do not need a university degree to be a software developer</h1>
      <p>A lot of people think they need a university degree to get a job as a software engineer. Forget university programs. Unless it's from Stanford or MIT, your degree will mean a lot less than having some apps to show off. In fact, most university programs struggle to keep up with changing technology. A degree will buy you a few thousand dollars more for the first 1-3 years. After that it makes exactly zero difference.</p>
      <p>Here's reality. (Data from the <a href="https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2016" target="_blank">2016 Stack Overflow survey</a> of 56,033 coders):</p>
      <div class="survey">
        <ul>
          <li>There is less than 1% difference in pay between masters degree holders and bootcamp graduates</li>
          <li>69% of working software developers are self-taught</li>
          <li>43% cite on-the-job training as their primary learning resource</li>
          <li>25% used online courses</li>
          <li>Only 19% have a masters degree related to CS</li>
          <li>Only 8.5% have a B.A. in CS</li>
          <li>6.5% graduated from a Bootcamp (this number is growing fast)</li>
        </ul>

      <p>When it comes to software engineering jobs, "or equivalent experience" is expressed or implied about 96% of the time. (About 4% of developer jobs require advanced math and science work).</p>
      <p>After 3 years on the job, and a track record of building great products, nobody cares anymore if you went to school, and for that reason, the pay difference evaporates as you pick up more experience.</p>
      <p>A college degree will earn you a few thousand dollars more per year, but only for the first 3 years. After that, it doesn't make any difference at all.</p>

      <h3 id="degree-is-useless">A Degree Won't Open More Doors than Faster, Less Expensive Options</h3>
      <p>The only thing employers really want to know about your education is whether or not you know how to code. All evidence of that will be considered (including a degree if you're junior), but employers have a strong preference for proof of skills in real code, not a piece of paper.</p>
      <p>The best way to learn to code is to code. The best way to prove you can code is to code.</p>

      <h3 id="degree-is-useful">Degrees Give You A Good CS Foundation in Theory</h3>
      <p>Yes, university CS does give you a solid foundation of algorithms, data structures, and computer science fundamentals. That is absolutely true, and it can certainly be valuable. You'll get a much stronger foundation in theory.</p>
      <p>The key here is in theory.</p>
      <p>The trouble is most universities don't help much at all with actual software engineering. Engineering is about applications, not theory.</p>
      <p>Most universities teach a variety of well-known cookie-cutter algorithms, many of which are not commonly used in modern programming languages because better alternatives are built into the language or standard libraries.</p>
      <p>What students really need to learn is how to solve problems with their own brains, rather than studying solutions out of textbooks whose first editions were written 30 years ago when applications were much, much different than they are today.</p>
    </section>

      <h3 id="the-real-world">The Real World</h3>
      <p>Meanwhile in the real world, it turns out that none of those algorithm choices will make anywhere near the performance impact as conserving your network or disk access, lazy evaluation or streams.</p>
      <p>And when you get to web scale and reach collection sizes where algorithm efficiency is really important, network, disk access, and streaming throw a big monkey wrench in analyzing the performance of your solutions — and the feasibility of any algorithm that relies on shared memory in the first place.</p>
      <p>When it comes to real applications, nothing is really as cut and dry as the theory describes.</p>
      <p>By concentrating on theory at the expense of concentrating on applications, students get a warped idea of performance profiles which doesn't take the physical realities of modern computation into account. Students learn to obsess over performance characteristics of things that don't make any practical difference to the performance of real apps.</p>
      <p>The good news is, you can skip some of the less valuable crap from CS courses and learn about concurrency, streams, working with machine clusters, and lazy evaluation instead of implementing yet another textbook, impractical, shared-memory sort algorithm that's already been implemented 10 million times, and is optimized for long-obsolete 1980 machine architecture.</p>

      <p>We have determined that tuition costs more. But let's review the additional costs and hidden fees.</p>
      <p>Mere living and existing expenses add up in a period of four years! You need to pay for dorms or dwell elsewhere. Add food, parking permits and a million hidden fees pertaining to your tuition.</p>
      <p>Resist the temptation for validation in the form of black hand-written letters on a white canvas framed in a blue sleek cover labeled "DIPLOMA". A four-year school can cost you a fortune — $40,000 on average assuming you're in-state. That's a base value without considering all the hidden fees and extra expenses. Engineering credits can cost extra.</p>
      <p>Another caveat of going to school for Computer Science is redundancy. Included in the curriculum are irrelevant classes such as diversity and core humanities. Think back to the high school where you had to listen to Mr. Smith's rambling during history classes. Well, it's the same thing, except now you're paying for it.</p>
      <p>Focus your efforts on online coding schools rather than dispersing them over a wide gamut of irrelevant classes while severely indebting yourself!</p>

      <p>Many Large Tech Companies No Longer Require Degrees. It's becoming more and more common for tech companies to no longer require a four-year degree to get an entry-level position. This opens the opportunity for many people searching for a new career to enter the tech industry. Whether you are a graduating high school senior looking to start a career, or an adult looking to change careers, you don't necessarily have to go to a four-year college to do so. In this article we will discuss why tech companies don't always require degrees, what companies don't require degrees, and the type of tech skills you must learn to apply.</p>
